I am a Full Stack Developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia and I love working with different languages and frameworks. My main passion is writing code for the web and right now nodejs, vue and golang are my favorite tools to get my work done. Currently I am juggling google app engine, nodejs, laravel, vuejs, aws, react native and nuxt.
