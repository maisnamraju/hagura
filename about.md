I am developer from a beautiful part of India and I love the interwebs; I love learning new things and my interests range from hiking and fishkeeping to working on various techologies, languages and frameworks; but I'm mad about Javascript at the moment.

Currently, I am working with Polymer, Nodejs, Angular, Laravel, Vue and Java. I am available for consulting on projects.
